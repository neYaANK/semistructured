    During this exercize I became familliar with SAX conversions and looked how XML to HTML and JSON conversions work under the hood.
    After working in the group I found better ways to implement conversions in Java.
    Overall my solution was fine, but for my teammates it was a bit simple. I hope my feedback helps my teammates.
    I didn't improve my solution because altough the example was not too complex, it still showed the core part of the topic and some interesting features.
    SAX topic is quite interesting, but I didn't encounter it anywhere else.
    I guess it would be interesting to try implementing SAX, that populates DB with XML data or creates a SQL query for an already predefined DB Scheme.
