    During this exercize I became familliar with property graphs and compared data structured in graphs and in XML.
    After working in the group I didn't find anything really new.
    Overall my solution was fine, except of the graph structure as it could be better.
    I hope my feedback helps my teammates, but their solution was alright too.
    I didn't improve my solution because it was overall alright.
    I don't have any suggestions, everything was fine.
