    During this exercize I became familliar with XQuery expressions and found the better way to operate and form XML data.
    After working in the group I didn't find anything really new, only other approaches to XQuery scrips.
    Overall my solution was fine. I hope my feedback helps my teammates, but their solution was alright too.
    I didn't improve my solution because it was fine.
    XQuery topic is quite interesting as it finally offers a way to manipulate XML data that is more readable and potent than XPath.
    I don't have any suggestions, everything was fine.
