    During this exercize I became familliar with semantics of XPath.
    After working in the group I found different interesting functions and ways to use them in XPath expresiion. 
    Feedback was a bit helpful but overall my solution was fine. I hope my feedback helps my teammates.
    I didn't improve my solution because everything was alright.
    The topic of XPath actually was quite useful as I have already encountered XPath when was learning more about web development.
    I don't have any ideas, everything is quite helpful already.
