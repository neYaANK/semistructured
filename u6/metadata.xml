    During this exercize I became familliar with DOM conversions and actually compared SAX and DOM way.
    After working in the group I found ...
    Overall my solution was fine. I hope my feedback helps my teammates.
    I didn't improve my solution because ...
    DOM topic is more interesting, as it is considered a standart and also is used not only in XML.
    I don't have any suggestions, everything was fine.
