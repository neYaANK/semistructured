    During this exercize I became familliar with core concepts of XML, DTDs and XML's validation.
    After working in the group I discovered that naming practices differ in other students' files.
    I also found out easier ways to do what I've done myself and overall that was quite helpful.
    For sure my feedback was helpful for my understanding of concepts and improving solution. I also hope my teammates feel so too.
    I did improve my solution by changing attribute names to be more descriptive. I did not change the structure because I find that this is subjective.
    The topic of DTD actually changed my view on semistructured data as I thought only of JSON without any constraints.
    I don't have any ideas, everything is quite helpful already.
